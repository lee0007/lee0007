- 👋 Hey, I’m @lee0007
- 👀 I’m interested in supporting the growth of decentralised ecosystems
- 🌱 I’m here to listen and learn mostly. I have a three year old son and I found myself envious of his capacity for learning, so I decided to sharpen up and venture back online to see what insights I might derive and what opportunities may arise.
- 💞️ catalyst : strategist : collaborator I'm keen to help where I can
